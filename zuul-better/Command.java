/**
 * This class is part of the "Insanity" application. 
 * "Insanity" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command can consist of five words, one command word which is what the user wants to do
 * and the other 4 words can be used to point to items or characters or used for filler words.
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then all the other words are <null>.
